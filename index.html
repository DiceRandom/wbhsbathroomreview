            In 2019 Disney studios reimagined the animated classic Aladdin. In this live action film the audience gets to
            relive the magic of Aladdin in a whole new way. This movie turned Broadway musical was filmed in the Wadi
            Rum Desert in Jordan for the desert scenes, but the majority of the movie was filmed in Longcross Studios in
            Surrey (UK). Aladdin was written by Guy Ritchie and John August, directed by Guy Ritche.In the story that takes place in the kingdom of Agrabah, Aladdin a street criminal and his monkey sidekick
            meet princess Jasmine. Aladdin falls in love with her but is not a prince so he can not be with her. Aladdin

            As a fan of horror movies, I was excited to see It Comes At Night available for viewing on Netflix. I
                remember hearing about it in 2017, the year of it’s release, but never actually seeing it in theaters.
                Watching the trailer made me excited and sold me on the idea of spending 91 minutes of my life on this
                movie. After watching it, I can say that I have never wasted 91 minutes of my life more than on this
                movie. I am all for abstract concepts and messages in movies, but if your audience leaves the film
                asking “..what was the point of that?” your messages were lost somewhere in the film. A lot of the issue
                comes in the advertising- with the way the tra...</p>

            This movie portrays a fairytale with a twist. Vivian, as a prostitute, never believed in love until she
                met billionaire Edward. Vivian was requested by Edward to stay for a week. All that had been in Vivians
                mind was that she was going to have sex with Edward with no connection, as she usually does with other
                clients. Pretty Woman is sure to keep your emotions running high, whether it’s anger, sadness,
                happiness, or pure bliss. This movie will touch eve...</p>

            Going into my viewing of The Double, I tried to keep details about the film reasonably
            scarce, so as not to spoil it. I even refrained from watching any trailers for the film, limiting my
            knowledge to four descriptors of the film: a sentence-long, unspecific blurb about it following a
            generic Google search, its 83% critics’ approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Jesse Eisenberg’s
            starring role in the film, and its role as Richard Ayoade’s second directorial effort. What I
            originally thought to be the most significant background information on the film in my arsenal
            was my having previously seen Ayoade’s directorial debut, a teen-oriente..</p>

            In 2016 a movie came out known as Nine Lives, the movie featured quite a few notable actors, was made on a
            30 million dollar budget, featured Kevin Spacey as the main actor (just a year before his teen touching
            habits were exposed), and is the only movie I know of where the wikipedia article immediately says it was
            known for being unoriginal and unfunny. It's notable for being yet another movie where the main character is
            a cgi animal (although it's worth noting this one was especially bad and terribly animated) and for intense
            scenes where characters literally fall off...

            This movie can be considered both a Bulls Horns Up and a Bulls Horns Down. Why this is the case is due
                to the nature of the film. If it is your first time watching a Star Wars movie then you will certainly
                gain interest in the other movies and become a fan. If you are a current Star Wars fan you will be
                disappointed to a great extent. I’ll reiterate, if you enjoy an action, slightly comic, sci-fi, movie
                and know little to nothing about Star Wars you will love it and end up watching all of the movies. If
                you are a die hard fan of the movies then it will just look sad. It’s a poor excuse as a final movie in
                a fantastic series. With multiple....
